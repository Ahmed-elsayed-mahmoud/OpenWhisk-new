# This playbook prepares all target hosts for Openwhisk installation.
# It will create the docker user and establish ssh keys.
# It will install all necessary packages to run Openwhisk playbooks.
# In addition it will also install docker on the target hosts

# If the docker user and ansible ssh user differ, use the following
# Set -e ansible_ssh_pass=xxx -e ansible_become_pass=xxx -e ansible_user=yyy when executing this playbook.
# xxx == passwd of a user that can become root or root passwd
# yyy == user that can become root or root itself
# Note that the user and passwd needs to be the same on all systems.
# Also you need to have sshpass installed.
# (apt-get for ubuntu, for mac: brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb)
